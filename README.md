This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project along with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Get Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the project work in action.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

Pretty simple project portfolio.
